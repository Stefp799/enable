        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Zoho Consulting Partner for Businesses That Need Results, Not Shelfware</h1>
        <p className="text-xl mb-8">We help companies turn Zoho into a system their teams actually use</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Zoho Consulting Matters</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Adopting Zoho can feel simple at first: sign up, click around, add a few fields. But without a strategy, most teams hit the same roadblocks:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Low adoption</strong> — sales reps avoid updating CRM, leaders stop trusting reports.</li>
          <li><strong>License waste</strong> — companies pay for Zoho One or bundles but use less than 30% of apps.</li>
          <li><strong>Disconnected processes</strong> — finance, sales, and operations run in silos.</li>
          <li><strong>Unclear ROI</strong> — executives can't prove Zoho is delivering growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-8">That's where consulting comes in. It's not about buying more apps — it's about aligning Zoho with your process, so the software bends to fit you, not the other way around.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Our Zoho Consulting Covers</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">We treat consulting as the discovery and design phase before (or during) implementation. Every engagement includes:</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Workflow Mapping</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">We document your sales, service, and finance workflows — and map them into Zoho CRM, Desk, Finance, or Creator.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">System Audit</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">If you already use Zoho, we run an audit: fields, automations, dashboards, and adoption. You get a clear list of what's working and what's broken.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Roadmap Creation</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">We prioritize quick wins and build a phased plan. You'll know what to do in Week 1 vs. Month 6 — so the rollout feels achievable.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Change Management</h3>
        <p className="mb-8">Zoho fails when users resist. We design training sessions, adoption strategies, and support plans to keep your team engaged.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Deep Dives: Consulting by Domain</h2>
