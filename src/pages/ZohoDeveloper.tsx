        <p className="text-xl mb-8 text-gray-600">Protecting your CRM investment with industry-specific expertise</p>

        <p className="mb-8">Manufacturing companies investing in Zoho CRM are not buying a simple database—they are building a production-critical system. The right Zoho developer can connect scheduling, inventory, and quality control into a single workflow. The wrong developer can stall production lines, disrupt customer communication, and cost six figures in wasted implementation.</p>

        <p className="mb-8">This page explains what manufacturing executives should look for when hiring a Zoho developer, the questions to ask, and why industry-specific experience matters.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Manufacturing Needs Specialized Zoho Developers</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Generic CRM consultants often know Zoho's features but not the realities of manufacturing operations. The difference shows up in areas like:</p>

        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Production Scheduling</strong> → Integration of customer orders with shop floor timelines</p>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Inventory Management</strong> → Real-time tracking across departments and warehouses</p>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Quality Control</strong> → Secure storage and easy retrieval of inspection data</p>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Supply Chain Coordination</strong> → Vendor and customer portals that actually reflect material flow</p>
        <p className="mb-6"><strong>Shop Floor Communication</strong> → Alerts and updates delivered without delay</p>

        <p className="mb-8">When developers don't understand these workflows, projects get rebuilt from scratch—at major cost to the business.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Five Red-Flag Scenarios to Test Any Developer</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">These simple questions separate real Zoho developers from unprepared freelancers.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Data Visibility Crisis</h3>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Scenario:</strong> Your production manager can't see pending orders. Yesterday they could. Today they see zero. What happened?</p>
        <p className="mb-6"><strong>Qualified Developer Answer:</strong> Understands Zoho views and permissions, can resolve filter errors without halting operations.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Customer Email Reliability</h3>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Scenario:</strong> Quotes and delivery updates are landing in customer spam folders. What's the immediate fix?</p>
        <p className="mb-6"><strong>Qualified Developer Answer:</strong> Configures domain authentication and email deliverability settings.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Data Backup and Recovery</h3>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Scenario:</strong> Scheduling data is corrupted. Can yesterday's records be restored?</p>
        <p className="mb-6"><strong>Qualified Developer Answer:</strong> Implements backup protocols and secure storage beyond Zoho's default two-week downloads.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Shop Floor Alerts</h3>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Scenario:</strong> A quality issue arises—can supervisors receive SMS from Zoho?</p>
        <p className="mb-6"><strong>Qualified Developer Answer:</strong> Knows Zoho's native limits, sets up third-party integration without overpromising.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Module Customization</h3>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Scenario:</strong> You don't need Deals. Can it be removed?</p>
        <p className="mb-8"><strong>Qualified Developer Answer:</strong> Streamlines interface via module customization, improving efficiency on the floor.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Framework for Evaluating Zoho Developers in Manufacturing</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">When evaluating partners, go beyond "Zoho Certified" badges. Ask for proof in three areas:</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Technical Competency</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>ERP and MRP integrations</li>
          <li>Real-time inventory management</li>
          <li>Multi-plant data synchronization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Business Continuity</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Backup and restore planning</li>
          <li>Maintenance windows aligned with production cycles</li>
          <li>Emergency support procedures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Communication Patterns</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
          <li>Customer notification automation</li>
          <li>Vendor coordination tools</li>
          <li>Shop floor messaging systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Cost of Choosing the Wrong Developer</h2>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Common Failure:</strong> Hiring a CRM generalist who reuses templates, ignores manufacturing workflows, and causes project restarts.</p>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Typical Loss:</strong> $50K–$200K implementations rebuilt within a year.</p>
        <p className="mb-8"><strong>Best Outcome:</strong> Partnering with a developer who maps processes before coding, aligns with production, and ensures operational reliability.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">FAQ: Hiring Zoho Developers for Manufacturing</h2>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q1. Why can't we just hire a generic Zoho freelancer?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Because freelancers often lack exposure to manufacturing workflows—leading to broken scheduling, lost orders, and costly rebuilds.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q2. What does a manufacturing Zoho developer do differently?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">They align Zoho CRM with your production, quality, and supply chain processes instead of forcing generic CRM templates onto your operations.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q3. How much does a Zoho implementation cost for manufacturing?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Most projects range from $50K–$200K depending on integrations and data complexity. The right developer ensures that investment isn't wasted.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q4. What's the risk if we don't back up properly?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Data loss in scheduling or quality control can stop a production line. A qualified developer builds secure, regular backup processes into your system.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q5. How quickly can Enable LLC deliver a working system?</h3>
        <p className="mb-8">Most manufacturing implementations are completed in about 90 days, with deployment planned around your production schedule.</p>
