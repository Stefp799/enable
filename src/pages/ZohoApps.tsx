              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Q: Which Zoho apps do most businesses actually need?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">A: Most of our clients start with Zoho CRM, Finance (Books, Invoice, Inventory), and Desk. These three cover sales, billing, and support. Other apps can be added as the business grows.</p>

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Q: Can we start small and add more Zoho apps later?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">A: Yes. Many businesses begin with just CRM and one or two other apps. As your team gets comfortable, we can extend your system with Creator, Analytics, or Campaigns.</p>
