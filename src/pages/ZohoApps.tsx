        <p className="text-xl mb-8">We help you get the most out of Zoho — configuring, customizing, and connecting the apps that actually solve your business problems. Instead of handing you a menu of dozens of tools, we focus on what drives results for your sales, service, finance, and operations.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Zoho CRM</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">The heart of most implementations, Zoho CRM organizes leads, tracks deals, and automates follow-up. We tailor workflows, dashboards, and automations so your team spends less time on admin and more time closing.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Zoho Creator</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">When off-the-shelf tools don't fit, Creator lets us build custom apps without heavy coding. From project tracking to unique approval flows, we design Creator apps that extend your system without creating headaches.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Zoho Bigin</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">For small teams that need CRM without the complexity, Bigin is a lightweight pipeline tool. We set it up to give you clarity on deals, tasks, and follow-ups — perfect for startups or focused sales groups.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Zoho Finance Suite</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">Managing money across Zoho Books, Invoice, and Inventory can be tricky. We configure the finance apps so quotes, invoices, and payments sync cleanly with CRM, giving you a clear line of sight from sales to cash.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Zoho One</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">Zoho CRM is the cornerstone of Zoho One, acting as a central force that streamlines sales, marketing, and customer support for businesses. This powerful tool collaborates with over 45 other Zoho applications, simplifying the overall management of your business operations.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Zoho Campaigns & Marketing Tools</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">From email campaigns to marketing automation, Zoho's marketing apps can drive real growth when properly connected to CRM. We make sure your campaigns are targeted, automated, and measurable.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Other Zoho Apps</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">From Projects to Sign to Flow, Zoho has dozens of specialized tools. We don't implement them all — only the ones that fit your process. Our job is to simplify, not overwhelm.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Work With Enable</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">Reports and dashboards are only useful if they answer the right questions. We design Analytics dashboards that combine CRM, finance, and other data sources so leaders see real insights — not just pretty charts.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q: Which Zoho apps do most businesses actually need?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">A: Most of our clients start with Zoho CRM, Finance (Books, Invoice, Inventory), and Desk. These three cover sales, billing, and support. Other apps can be added as the business grows.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q: Can we start small and add more Zoho apps later?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">A: Yes. Many businesses begin with just CRM and one or two other apps. As your team gets comfortable, we can extend your system with Creator, Analytics, or Campaigns.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q: Do you integrate Zoho apps with non-Zoho tools?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">A: Absolutely. We connect Zoho to third-party systems like QuickBooks, Salesforce, and custom apps. Our goal is a single flow of data without double entry.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Q: Do you provide training and support?</h3>
        <p className="mb-8">A: Yes. Every implementation includes user training and documentation. For ongoing needs, our subscription packages cover updates, automation tuning, and support.</p>
