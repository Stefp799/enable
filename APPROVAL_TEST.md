Approval Policy Sanity Check

- Created by the assistant to verify workspace write access without escalation.
- Expected behavior: no approval prompt for workspace writes under on-request policy.
- If an approval modal appeared, your policy is stricter than intended.

You can delete this file after validation.
 
Update: Assistant was able to modify this file without any approval prompts.
